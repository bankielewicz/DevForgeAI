# PRD-001 — Volunteer shift sign-up for the Riverside Food Bank

## 1. Summary

Let the food bank's volunteers book warehouse shifts themselves instead of by phone, and give the
coordinator a live roster.

## 2. Problem and opportunity

The coordinator fills three warehouse shifts a day by phone, and about one shift in six starts
short-staffed (BRN-001#PRB-01).

## 3. Users and personas

About 120 active volunteers, who book from their phones, and one volunteer coordinator.

## 4. Goals and non-goals

**Goals**
- Volunteers book their own shifts.

**Non-goals** (explicitly out of scope)
- Payroll and donations; volunteers aren't paid.

## 5. Success metrics

```yaml items
success_metrics:
  - id: SM-01
    status: active
    metric: "Share of shifts that start fully staffed"
    baseline: "83%"
    target: "95% by the end of the pilot"
    measured_by: "Coordinator's shift log"
    upstream:
      - {id: BRN-001, item: IDEA-01, relation: derives, version: 1, hash: null}
```

## 6. Functional requirements

```yaml items
functional_requirements:
  - id: FR-001
    status: active
    statement: "The system shall let a volunteer sign in."
    priority: must
    release: current
    notes: null
    upstream:
      - {id: BRN-001, item: IDEA-01, relation: derives, version: 1, hash: null}
  - id: FR-002
    status: active
    statement: "The system shall let a signed-in volunteer book an open warehouse shift."
    priority: must
    release: current
    notes: null
    upstream:
      - {id: BRN-001, item: IDEA-01, relation: derives, version: 1, hash: null}
  - id: FR-003
    status: active
    statement: "The system shall show the coordinator each day's roster of booked volunteers."
    priority: should
    release: current
    notes: null
    upstream:
      - {id: BRN-001, item: IDEA-02, relation: derives, version: 1, hash: null}
```

## 7. Non-functional requirements

```yaml items
non_functional_requirements:
  - id: NFR-001
    status: active
    category: security
    statement: "An administrator can revoke a volunteer's signed-in sessions, and a revoked session stops working within 5 minutes."
    priority: must
    release: current
  - id: NFR-002
    status: active
    category: privacy
    statement: "Volunteer phone numbers are visible only to the coordinator."
    priority: must
    release: current
  - id: NFR-003
    status: active
    category: constraint
    statement: "The food bank has no on-site server, so the system runs on hosted services (applies to the whole product)."
    priority: must
    release: current
```

## 8. User experience

Mobile-first web pages; no app to install.

## 9. Constraints and dependencies

NFR-003 records the hosting constraint.

## 10. Assumptions and risks

```yaml items
assumptions:
  - id: ASM-01
    status: active
    statement: "Most volunteers have a smartphone with a web browser."
    validation: "Ask at the September volunteer meeting"
    state: open
    upstream:
      - {id: BRN-001, item: ASM-01, relation: derives, version: 1, hash: null}
```

## 11. Release and rollout

Pilot with the Tuesday and Thursday shifts, then every shift.

## 12. Open questions

- [NEEDS ADR: identity provider for volunteer sign-in; affects FR-001]

## 13. Epic map
