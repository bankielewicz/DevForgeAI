# ARCH-002 — Riverside Food Bank volunteer shift sign-up architecture

## 1. Context and scope

Defined against PRD-001 version 1 (approved): volunteers sign in, book warehouse shifts, and the coordinator sees the roster. No inspection scope was named, and no code was inspected.

## 2. Quality drivers

NFR-001 (session revocation) and NFR-002 (private phone numbers) drive the design; NFR-003 rules out an on-site server.

## 3. Components

```

## 4. Architectural questions

```yaml items
decisions:
  - id: DEC-01
    status: active
    question: "Which identity provider handles volunteer sign-in?"
    blocking: true
    state: open
    resolved_by: []
    notes: null
    upstream:
      - {id: PRD-001, item: FR-001, relation: informed_by, version: 1, hash: null}
  - id: DEC-02
    status: active
    question: "How are a volunteer's sessions revoked within 5 minutes (NFR-001)?"
    blocking: true
    state: open
    resolved_by: []
    notes: null
    upstream:
      - {id: PRD-001, item: FR-001, relation: informed_by, version: 1, hash: null}
      - {id: PRD-001, item: NFR-001, relation: informed_by, version: 1, hash: null}
```

## 5. Evidence inspected

```yaml items
evidence:
  - id: EVD-01
    status: active
    source: "PRD-001"
    kind: prd
    finding: "Version 1, status approved: sign-in (FR-001) with session revocation (NFR-001); the identity provider is a NEEDS ADR marker."
    classification: context
```
