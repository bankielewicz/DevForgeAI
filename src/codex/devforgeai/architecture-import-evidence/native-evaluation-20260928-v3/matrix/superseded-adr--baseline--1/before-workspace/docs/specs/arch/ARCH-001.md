# ARCH-001 — Riverside Food Bank volunteer shift sign-up architecture

## 1. Context and scope

Defined against PRD-001 version 1 (approved): volunteers sign in and book warehouse shifts. Payroll and donations are outside the system. No inspection scope was named, and no code was inspected.

## 2. Quality drivers

NFR-001 (phone numbers visible only to the coordinator) drives data ownership.

## 3. Components
