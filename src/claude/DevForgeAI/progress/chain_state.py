"""The chain listing of a DevForgeAI project (SPEC-012 version 17, IF-03, BEH-26, ERR-13, ERR-14).

Run from anywhere:
    python3 chain_state.py --root DIR

Lists the Markdown documents under DIR/docs/specs/ as JSON (DM-05, devforgeai-chain/1) on stdout: for each document with
a frontmatter `id`, its id, type, status, version, updated, path and the IDs of its `upstream` entries. It reads each
file only as far as the line that closes its frontmatter, and the frontmatter by the text of its top-level keys, not as
YAML (SPEC-012 section 4). It judges nothing: it reads no body, checks no status, version or link, and does not say which
phase a project is in.

Exit 0 whenever it prints, an empty `documents` list when there is no docs/specs/; exit 2, with nothing on stdout and
one line on stderr, when --root is missing, isn't a folder or can't be read, or an argument is unknown. It follows no
symbolic link, writes no file, opens no network connection and runs no other program (QR-06). Standard library only; the
same files under --root always give the same bytes (QR-05).
