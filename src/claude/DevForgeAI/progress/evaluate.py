"""Progress evaluator for DevForgeAI skill runs (SPEC-012 v16).

Run from the project root:
    python3 evaluate.py evaluate --manifests DIR [--manifests DIR ...] --events FILE --out FILE
                                 [--root DIR] [--phases FILE]
    python3 evaluate.py check --manifests DIR --skill NAME --checklist FILE

`evaluate` (IF-01) reads a run's event log (devforgeai-events/1) and the skill's manifest
(devforgeai-manifest/1), in layers, and writes the run's progress state (devforgeai-progress/1).
It exits 0 when the state is written, with or without flags, and 2 when it can't run, with one line
on stderr. `check` (IF-02) compares a skill's checklist with its manifest: exit 0 when they match,
1 when the manifest is stale, missing or names invalid workFiles, 2 when it can't run.

The evaluator is a pure function of its inputs (BEH-01): each call reads the whole event log, keeps
nothing between calls, and reads no clock. It uses the Python standard library only (QR-01), reads
only the files its command names and, with --root, the files a run wrote (QR-04), and writes only
--out.
