"""The cross-run figures of a DevForgeAI project (SPEC-012 version 17, IF-04, BEH-27, BEH-28, ERR-14 to ERR-16).

Run from anywhere:
    python3 history.py --root DIR

Reads the finished runs' states, DIR/devforgeai/progress/runs/<run>/state.json, and the odometer ledger, the .jsonl files
directly in DIR/devforgeai/progress/odometer/, and prints JSON (DM-06, devforgeai-history/1) on stdout: for each skill the
runs read, the complete ones and the median of their active seconds; the ledger's token totals; and how many states were
read and left out. Both are one pass over each file, and neither reads a clock.

Exit 0 whenever it prints, with no runs or no ledger giving empty and zero figures; exit 2, with nothing on stdout and one
line on stderr, when --root is missing, isn't a folder or can't be read, an argument is unknown, or a ledger file that
exists can't be read. It follows no symbolic link, writes no file, opens no network connection and runs no other program
(QR-06). Standard library only; the same files under --root always give the same bytes (QR-05).
