"""Remove old working files of DevForgeAI's progress tracker and a skill's work files: SPEC-013 IF-04 and IF-05, run
by the adapter (BEH-19, BEH-32).

    prune  --root DIR --days N [--keep-session ID] [--keep-run ID ...] [--manifests DIR]
    remove --root DIR --manifests DIR --file=PATH [--file=PATH ...]

Under DIR/devforgeai/progress/ it removes each folder runs/<name> whose name is a run ID (SPEC-012 §4) and each
sessions/<name> whose name is a session ID (a UUID), when the newest entry in it, the folder included, was last
modified more than N days ago, other than the kept session's and run's folders. A session ID of another shape is
left alone. It never follows a symbolic link: every folder is opened by a descriptor without following one and
everything beneath it is reached through that descriptor, so a folder swapped for a link meanwhile is never entered;
it skips a link, and leaves any folder that holds one. It deletes nothing else. A folder that changes or vanishes
while it works, as another session's prune or an active run makes it, is skipped. A platform without descriptor
support (Windows) is refused rather than walked by path.

Prints "pruned <r> runs, <s> sessions"; exit 0, also when there is no devforgeai/progress/; exit 2 with one line on
stderr when DIR isn't a folder, N isn't a whole number of at least 1, the platform lacks descriptor support, or a
deletion fails (after both kinds were tried, naming the first failure).

With --manifests, prune also removes work files by age (version 20): each regular file under DIR/devforgeai/drafts/
whose project-relative path matches a `workFiles` pattern of the plugin's manifests, whose newest modification is more
than N days ago, and which no runs/<name>/state.json still standing after the folder pass lists in workFiles.files
(untrusted, as the model can write it: it can only keep a file, never choose one). It removes no folder and follows no
link. It prints "pruned <r> runs, <s> sessions, <w> work files".

remove deletes only the regular files named by --file (a project-relative path with no empty, . or .. segment) that
match a pattern, each folder on the way opened by descriptor without following a link. The patterns are those of the
`*.json` manifests in the one --manifests folder; a manifest holding a pattern that is no string, doesn't begin
devforgeai/drafts/ or holds a .. segment is ignored as a whole and named on the output line ("; ignored <file>:
<reason>"). A path it won't remove, or a file that vanished or changed meanwhile, is skipped and counted. It prints
"removed <n> work files, skipped <k>"; exit 2 with one line on stderr when DIR isn't a folder, no --file is given, the
platform lacks descriptor support, or an unlink fails with any other error (after the other paths were tried).

The adapter starts it as a process because the mods API can't delete files ($.fs has no delete). Standard library
only; runs under python3 -S (QR-04).
