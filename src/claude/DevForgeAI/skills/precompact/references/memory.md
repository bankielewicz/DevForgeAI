# Saving learnings to memory

Memory carries what a project's files don't: it outlives the handoff, which is about one piece of work. Save after
the handoff files are written, so a session cut off midway still leaves START-HERE.md.

## When there is a memory system

Use memory only when the session's own instructions describe one: where memories live and their format. Follow that
format exactly. For example, Claude Code's file-based memory keeps one fact per file, with a frontmatter of a name,
a one-line description and a type, plus one line per memory in an index file; it is written with the Write and Edit
tools, and the index line is added after the file. Another system may differ: its instructions decide.

## What to save

Save a learning that is durable and not recorded elsewhere:
- a decision with its reason, in the decider's words and with its date, when it outlives this piece of work;
- a verified fact about a tool, a platform or the environment (with how it was verified and when);
- a practice the user asked for or confirmed ("run the integration tests with the staging flag");
- a trap that cost time, with its fix.

Don't save:
- what the repository, its instructions or its history already record (code structure, a past fix, a commit);
- what matters only to this conversation or this piece of work: that belongs in START-HERE;
- a secret: no token, key or password, even one said in the conversation.

## How to save

1. Look for an existing memory that covers the same fact, by its index line or name. Update that one (Edit) rather
   than adding a duplicate; delete or correct a memory this session proved wrong.
2. Write each new memory in the system's format, one fact each, with the date as YYYY-MM-DD, not "today".
3. Add or update its index line.
4. Name each saved or updated memory in the report.

## When there is none, or a write is refused

When the session's instructions describe no memory system, or a memory write is refused (a read-only folder, a
denied tool), the learnings stay in START-HERE section 6, and the report says why none were saved.
