# Handoff rules

The next session may start cold: after `/compact` it has only a summary, and in a new session it has nothing. It
can read files and run commands, but it can't see this conversation. Write so that it can act without asking about
anything this session knew: full fidelity, zero ambiguity, and pointers instead of copies. SKILL.md has the steps;
this file has what goes in each section, with examples, and the self-check.

## The folder

- `devforgeai/handoff/.gitignore` holds the single line `*`: the handoff is working notes for the next session on
  this machine, never committed.
- `devforgeai/handoff/<folder>/` holds `START-HERE.md`, `RESUME-PROMPT.md`, `TASKS.md`, and `TASKS-archive.md` once
  TASKS.md has more than 20 done entries (create it with the heading `# Tasks archive`).
- A path named in section 4 or in a Markdown link must exist. Mark one that will exist later `(not yet created)` on
  its line, and one valid only until the session ends (a scratch file) `(session-only)` on its line or the line
  above. Give evidence as text (a commit hash, a PR number), not as links, so an old entry never points at a file
  since removed.

## START-HERE.md, section by section

Start from `assets/start-here.md`. Replace every `[[fill: ...]]`; delete a line the fill says to delete when it
doesn't apply. More `##` sections may follow section 7; `###` headings may go anywhere.

**1. What this is.** Two or three sentences a stranger understands, then the project root, the work's branch (with
its worktree's path when the session works in another worktree, and the checkout the session runs in), the time
written (UTC) and the session ID. Several sessions may run in one checkout on one branch while each works in its own
worktree: the folder follows the work's branch, so each keeps its own handoff. When the session's progress tracker has an open run, name it and its step.

**2. Verified state.** One fact per bullet, each ending with how it was checked, or `(unverified: <source>, <date>)`.
- Good: `- PR #12 is open as a draft [checked: gh pr view 12 --json isDraft -> true]`
- Good: `- 214 tests passed (unverified: the session's run of 2026-10-05)`
- Good: `- git isn't used: its top level is a parent folder [checked: git rev-parse --show-toplevel -> a parent folder]`
- Good: `- src/export.py: the delimiter parameter, unfinished; finish it, then commit [checked: git diff --stat -> 1 file]`
- Bad: `- Tests pass` (which tests, checked how, when?)

**3. Decisions.** Under `### Decided`, each decision with who decided, the date and their words in double quotes:
`- CSV only, no Excel: Dana, 2026-10-04, "CSV is enough for now"`. With nothing decided, the line `None.` without a
dash. Under `### Open`, each question still the user's, with the options as the user saw them. Never move an open
question to Decided because it seems settled, and never write a decision to fill the section: only the user's words
decide.

**4. Read first.** A numbered list; each item starts with the path in backticks, then why and when to read it. For a
long file, give the search after the path: ``2. `docs/design.md` - the export format; run `grep -n "delimiter"
docs/design.md` rather than reading it whole``. When the session keeps its own plan or task file, list it as the
source of truth for the steps it lists. End with the line "When something you need isn't here, search the repository
and memory before asking the user."

**5. Outstanding.** The user's note first, when the skill was given one. Then a numbered list in order:
`1. Fix the delimiter. Next: edit src/export.py:42. Waits for: nothing.` or
`2. Release. Next: ask the user which version. Waits for: the user's choice (section 3, Open).`
With nothing left, the single line `Nothing outstanding.`

**6. Rules, traps and learnings.** What cost time and how to avoid it, approaches tried and dropped with why, the
project rules that apply (cite the file, don't restate it), and this session's learnings. The durable ones also go to
memory (`references/memory.md`).

**7. Before acting.** Commands to run first, each with what it shows if nothing changed:
`- git log -n 1 --oneline - shows a1b2c3d`.

**Carrying over an earlier handoff.** When the folder holds an earlier START-HERE.md, keep what still holds: its
decisions, open questions, rules, traps and learnings, and its outstanding items not finished; drop what is done
(TASKS.md keeps it). When the earlier handoff is about other work (another topic on the same branch), keep its
TASKS.md entries under a `##` heading naming that work, after the required ones, write START-HERE for the current
work, and name the earlier work in section 5 as not continued here.

## TASKS.md

Mark what this session finished as done, with its evidence
(`- [x] Exporter written: commit 9f8e7d6, 12 tests pass (2026-10-05)`), and list what is next with its next action.
Update an earlier TASKS.md, never replace it; keep the last 20 done entries and move older ones, oldest first, to
TASKS-archive.md.

## The checker's warnings

Exit 0 can come with warnings: START-HERE over 250 lines, or `today`, `yesterday`, `tomorrow` or `recently` outside
quotes and code. Fix a warning when it is cheap (write the date; point to a file instead of copying it).

## The self-check

For all three files; the script checks the items marked (script), the session reads back for the rest:
1. every required heading in order, no `[[fill:` left, RESUME-PROMPT within 40 lines naming START-HERE.md by its
   absolute path (script);
2. every §2 bullet ends `[checked: …]` or `(unverified)`, every `### Decided` bullet holds a date and a quote, every §5
   item holds `Next:` and `Waits for:` (script);
3. every §4 path and every Markdown link exists, or its line or the line above says `(not yet created)` or
   `(session-only)` (valid only until the session ends) (script);
4. exact identifiers: commit hashes, branch names, pull request numbers, versions, document and item IDs, test counts
   with the command that gave them;
5. absolute dates, never "today" or "yesterday" (the script warns);
6. names, not pronouns whose referent the next session can't see ("PR #91", not "the PR");
7. each outstanding item's next action concrete enough to do without asking;
8. nothing secret: no token, key or password, even one said in the conversation;
9. START-HERE within about 250 lines, pointing to files instead of copying them (the script warns past 250).
