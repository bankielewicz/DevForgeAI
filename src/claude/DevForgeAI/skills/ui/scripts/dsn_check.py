"""Check a DevForgeAI design document (DSN) and the boards folder it records (SPEC-017 IF-01 to IF-04).

Usage:
    python3 dsn_check.py next [--root DIR]
    python3 dsn_check.py boards [--root DIR] DSN-NNN
    python3 dsn_check.py check [--before-amend] [--root DIR] DSN-NNN
    python3 dsn_check.py head [--root DIR] DSN-NNN FILE

DIR is the project root (`.` by default). Output is on standard output. Exit 0 is success, 1 a problem the script
reports, 2 that it cannot run: no or wrong arguments, a root it cannot read, a DSN file or a BRN it cannot read. A run
that cannot run prints one line, `Cannot run: <reason>.`, and nothing else. A boards folder that fails DM-04 is a problem
it reports, in every subcommand that reads it: `ERR-03`, `ERR-04`, `ERR-05` or `ERR-12` (the first that fails), or an
`ERR-06` line for every board that fails; `check` (without --before-amend) reports it as one `boards` error.

- next: prints `next: DSN-NNN` (one more than the highest DSN-NNN.md in docs/specs/design/, DSN-001 with none) and
  `pending boards folders: ...`. It reads only the names in that folder.
- boards: checks docs/specs/design/DSN-NNN/boards/ against the canvas.json contract (DM-04) and prints
  `canvas.json: v<N>, <n> boards`, a `board <k> <file> <bytes> <lines> <sha256>` line for each board in canvas order
  and `boards: ok`; or ERR-03, ERR-04, ERR-05 or ERR-12 (the first that fails), or an ERR-06 line for every board that
  fails, then `boards: <n> problem(s)`.
- check: applies the rules of the DSN (frontmatter, boards, mapping, links, coverage, approval, changelog, placeholder)
  and prints `<file>:<line>: <part>: <message> (<rule>)` for each error, `warning: ...` for each suspect reference,
  then `OK <file>` or `INVALID: <n> error(s) in <file>`. With --before-amend it applies the structural rules only and
  prints what it did not enforce as `fact: ...` lines (the facts an amend run starts from), then
  `OK <file> (before amend)` or `INVALID: ...`.
- head: prints at most 150 lines and 16 KB of one board file that canvas.json names, a line over 500 characters cut to
  500 and marked `[cut]`, then `head: <shown> of <lines> lines, <bytes shown> of <bytes> bytes, <n> lines cut`: what was
  left out is the difference between the "of" numbers, and <n> is the number of lines that were cut short.

Standard library only: it runs under `python3 -S`. It writes no file, opens no network connection, starts no process,
follows no symbolic link and reads only the paths each subcommand names. It reads the frontmatter and the `boards:`
block with a fixed-shape reader (flat mappings, flow sequences, double-quoted scalars with escapes, integers, dates and
null); PyYAML, when installed, is only a syntax cross-check and gives the same verdict.
