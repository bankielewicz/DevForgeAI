## When to use this

Read this at SKILL.md step 3 (find the ARCH), step 4 (compute readiness) and step 5 (select).

## Finding the current ARCH

Read the frontmatter of every `docs/specs/arch/ARCH-*.md`. Ignore an ARCH whose `status` is `superseded` or
`deprecated`. An active ARCH **cites this PRD** when its frontmatter `upstream` has a link whose `id` is
this PRD's ID (with no `item`). Links on items inside the ARCH don't count. An ARCH can cite several
PRDs.

| What you find | Result |
|---|---|
| No active ARCH cites the PRD, or the folder doesn't exist | **ERR-02.** Write nothing. Readiness comes from the architecture description, so tell the user to run `/devforgeai:architecture PRD-NNN` first |
| One active ARCH cites it, and that link's `version` equals the PRD's `version` | It is the **current ARCH**. Use it |
| One active ARCH cites it, and that link's `version` differs from the PRD's `version` (usually older; newer only after a hand edit) | **ERR-03.** Write nothing. Name both versions ("ARCH-001 was last reviewed against PRD-001 v1; the PRD is now v2") and tell the user to review the architecture against this PRD version with `/devforgeai:architecture PRD-NNN`. Confirming reuse there records the review; the architecture changes only if the review finds it must |
| Several active ARCHs cite it | **ERR-04.** List each with its `system` and the version of its PRD link, and ask which one to use. Never pick one silently. With no one to answer, write nothing |

A version mismatch means a review is due, not that the architecture is wrong. Never treat an ARCH
reviewed against an older PRD version as current, and never treat "no ARCH" as "nothing blocks".

## The readiness rule

Apply it to every active FR and NFR of the PRD, from the current ARCH's `decisions` block and the ADR and
policy files as they are **now**. A DEC **cites** R when its `upstream` has a link whose `id` is this
PRD's ID and whose `item` is R. A link to another PRD's item with the same number is not R: an ARCH can
cover several PRDs, so always match the PRD ID and the item together.

A requirement R is **ready** when, for every DEC with `status: active` and `blocking: true` that cites R:
- `state` is `resolved`, and
- every `resolved_by` entry counts:
  - `ADR-NNN`: `docs/specs/adr/ADR-NNN.md` exists, and its frontmatter has `status: accepted` and
    `superseded_by: null`. Read the file; never trust what the ARCH, its evidence or its notes say
    about the ADR.
  - `POL-NNN#SET-NN`: it passes the bounded policy check below.

In addition, every `[NEEDS ADR]` marker that names R must have its own matching DEC (next section).

The outcome for R is one of:
- **ready**: every DEC that cites R passes, and every marker naming R is matched.
- **blocked**, naming each cause:
  - a DEC whose `state` is `open`: `DEC-01 (open)`;
  - a DEC resolved by an ADR that no longer counts: `DEC-03 (ADR-002 superseded by ADR-003)`, or
    `(ADR-007 is proposed)`, `(… rejected)`, `(… deprecated)`;
  - a marker with no matching DEC: `[NEEDS ADR] marker without a matching question ("<the marker's
    decision>")`;
  - a marker whose question a DEC asks without citing every requirement the marker names, so the marker
    is still unmatched: `[NEEDS ADR] marker: DEC-04 asks "<the marker's decision>" but doesn't cite
    FR-002`. Every requirement the marker names gets this reason.
- **unknown**, naming the input: readiness can't be established, so R is never asserted ready or blocked
  on that point. Causes:
  - a resolving ADR's file is missing (`ADR-004 not found`) or unreadable;
  - a `resolved_by` entry in no recognizable form;
  - a DEC with `state: resolved` and an empty `resolved_by` (`DEC-05 is resolved by nothing`);
  - a policy resolver that fails the bounded check (next sections).

A DEC blocks **only** the requirements it cites. A DEC with `blocking: false` or `status: deprecated`
blocks nothing. A requirement no DEC cites and no marker names is ready. If one DEC blocks R and another
is unknown, R has both reasons.

## Matching `[NEEDS ADR]` markers

Find every `[NEEDS ADR: <decision>; affects FR-NNN, …]` marker in the PRD. For each one, look for its
**matching DEC**: an active DEC whose `question` asks the marker's decision, and whose `upstream` cites
every requirement the marker names. "Which identity provider handles sign-in?" matches
`[NEEDS ADR: identity provider for sign-in; affects FR-001]`.

- A matching DEC is then judged like any other DEC: open, resolved by a resolver that counts, or not. A
  resolver that counts answers the marker, whether it is an accepted ADR or a policy setting that passes
  the bounded check: a mandated platform settles the decision as an ADR does (SPEC-003 BEH-07).
- **No DEC clearly asks the marker's decision:** every requirement the marker names is **blocked**
  ("marker without a matching question"), even when other DECs citing that requirement are resolved.
- **A DEC asks the marker's decision but doesn't cite every requirement the marker names:** the marker
  is still unmatched, and every requirement it names is blocked with the reason that says which
  requirement the DEC doesn't cite (readiness rule, above).
- A resolved DEC about a **different** decision never answers the marker, even when it cites the same
  requirement: an audit-storage DEC doesn't answer a payment-provider marker. When in doubt, treat the
  marker as unmatched; a wrong "ready" is worse than a wrong "blocked".

## The bounded policy check

A `POL-NNN#SET-NN` resolver counts only when all four hold. This is a check, not policy resolution: never
apply defaults or local preferences, and never resolve anything else from policy.

1. **Approved.** `docs/specs/policy/POL-NNN.md` exists and has `status: approved`.
2. **Active mandate.** Setting `SET-NN` in its `settings` block has `status: active` and
   `key: architecture.mandated_platforms`, the only kind of setting that resolves a DEC.
3. **Unchanged since the ARCH applied it.** The ARCH has a link to the setting: `id: POL-NNN` and
   `item: SET-NN`, usually on the component that provides the capability.
   - **Same version.** The link's `version` equals the policy document's `version`: check 3 passes.
     Read nothing more.
   - **Different version.** Find the ARCH's **current resolution line**: the `Policy resolution:` line
     in the *last* Change Log row that has one. Create, amend and reuse-review rows have one; approval
     rows don't. Never fall back to an older row. Build the entry from the setting's current `value`:
     `architecture.mandated_platforms=<platform> for <capability> (POL-NNN#SET-NN)`. Compare it with the
     line as exact text, after trimming spaces around the platform and the capability. The architecture
     step copies both verbatim, so ignore nothing else.
     - The line contains the entry: check 3 passes. Note the newer version in the reply's notes
       (SKILL.md step 9, item 2).
     - The line names `POL-NNN#SET-NN` with a different platform or capability: the setting changed.
     - The line doesn't name `POL-NNN#SET-NN`, or no Change Log row has a `Policy resolution:` line at
       all: the ARCH no longer applies it.
4. **No contested mandate.** No other approved document in `docs/specs/policy/` has an active
   `architecture.mandated_platforms` setting for the **same capability**. Compare capabilities as the
   policy script does: trim outer spaces and ignore case, but inner spaces count; no other
   normalization. Settings for different capabilities never conflict, so an organization policy and a
   project policy can each mandate platforms. The one exception for the same capability is a permitted
   override: the resolver is the project policy's setting (frontmatter `scope: project`), and the
   organization policy's setting (`scope: organization`) has `overridable_by` including `project`. An
   organization setting that such an override replaces fails this check.

If any check fails, R is **unknown**, naming the resolver and the condition that failed:
- `POL-001#SET-01 fails the policy check: setting deprecated (check 2)`
- `POL-001#SET-01 fails the policy check: ARCH-001 has no link to it (check 3)`
- `POL-001#SET-01 fails the policy check: changed since ARCH-001 applied it; now "<platform> for <capability>" (check 3)`
- `POL-001#SET-01 fails the policy check: ARCH-001's latest resolution no longer applies it (check 3)`
- `POL-001#SET-01 fails the policy check: POL-002#SET-01 also mandates "<capability>" (check 4)`

The next action is to review the architecture with `/devforgeai:architecture PRD-NNN`, which re-resolves
policy. A resolver that passes at a newer policy version counts; say so in the reply's notes (SKILL.md
step 9, item 2), for example
`POL-001#SET-01 still counts: POL-001 is now v2, ARCH-001 linked v1, and the setting is unchanged`.

## Covered requirements

Read the frontmatter of every `docs/specs/epic/EPIC-*.md`. An existing epic is **active** unless its
`status` is `superseded` or `deprecated`. An FR is **covered** when an active existing epic's frontmatter
`upstream` has a link with `relation: refines`, `id` equal to this PRD's ID and `item` equal to the FR's
ID, at any `version`.

- An FR of another PRD with the same number is not this FR: both the PRD ID and the item must match.
- **NFRs are never covered.** An existing epic that refines an eligible NFR doesn't stop it being
  attached to the new epics it constrains (SKILL.md step 6). If no new epic attaches it, its row reads
  `already refined by EPIC-NNN` (Left-out rows).
- A covered FR that is also blocked or unknown now gets both reasons: the existing epic's work rests on
  a question that is no longer settled.
- Existing epics are read-only: never modify, renumber, supersede or duplicate one.

## The selection rule

A requirement R of the PRD (an FR or an NFR) is **eligible** when all hold:
1. `status: active`;
2. R is ready;
3. `release: current`;
4. `priority` is `must`, `should` or `could`;
5. for an FR only: R is not covered.

Priority orders the epics and never selects on its own, apart from `wont`. A `null` release, or a `null`
priority with `release: current`, is **undecided**: it belongs to the PRD owner, never to you. A `later`
requirement always has `priority: null`, because the prd skill writes later requirements that way. That
null is not undecided.

## Left-out rows

Every requirement that is in no new epic gets **one row** in the reply. That is every requirement that
isn't eligible, plus any eligible NFR that no new epic attaches. A row gives **every reason that
applies**, in the order below, and **one next action: the first listed reason's**. Several reasons never
mean several questions, and a row never asks the user anything.

| Order | Reason, as written in the row | When | Next action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `deprecated` | `status` is not `active` | `No action.` |
| 2 | `won't have (priority wont)` | `priority: wont` | `No action for this release.` |
| 3 | `later (release later)` | `release: later`. Never add `undecided` for its null priority | `No action for the current release.` |
| 4 | `undecided (priority null)`, `(release null)` or `(priority and release null)` | `release` is `null`, or `priority` is `null` with `release: current` | `The PRD owner decides.` |
| 5 | `covered by EPIC-NNN` | An active existing epic refines this FR | `No action.`, or when also blocked or unknown: `Review EPIC-NNN's work before continuing.` |
| 6 | `blocked by DEC-NN (<cause>)`, or `blocked: [NEEDS ADR] marker …` (readiness rule) | Not ready | `Resolve it with /devforgeai:architecture PRD-NNN.` |
| 7 | `unknown: <input and failed condition>` | Readiness can't be established | `Fix <the input>, or review the architecture with /devforgeai:architecture PRD-NNN, then run again.` |
| — | `already refined by EPIC-NNN` | An eligible NFR that no new epic attaches. An active existing epic always refines it, because otherwise a standalone NFR epic is written | `No action.` |

Compute readiness for a requirement left out for another reason too (`later`, `wont`, `undecided`), and
list its blocking DECs: they tell the PRD owner what else waits. A deprecated requirement gets only
`deprecated`. An NFR is never `covered`. Only an eligible NFR that no new epic attaches gets
`already refined by EPIC-NNN`; an ineligible NFR gets only its own reasons, even when an existing epic
refines it.

Row format, one line each, the requirement ID first:

```
- FR-005: later (release later); blocked by DEC-06 (open). No action for the current release.
- FR-008: covered by EPIC-002; blocked by DEC-03 (ADR-002 superseded by ADR-003). Review EPIC-002's work before continuing.
- NFR-001: already refined by EPIC-001. No action.
```

## Worked example

PRD-003 (version 4) has FR-001 to FR-006 and NFR-001, and
`[NEEDS ADR: calendar sync with the practice system; affects FR-002]`. ARCH-002 cites PRD-003 at version 4.
EPIC-004 (approved) refines FR-001.

| DEC | Question | Cites | State | Resolver now |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEC-01 | Which component owns appointment data? | FR-001, FR-002, NFR-001 | resolved | ADR-005, accepted |
| DEC-02 | How are SMS reminders sent? | FR-003 | resolved | ADR-006, superseded by ADR-009 |
| DEC-03 | Which video service hosts remote visits? | FR-004 | open | none |

FR-004 has `release: later` (with `priority: null`, as the prd skill writes it), FR-005 has
`priority: null` with `release: current`, and FR-006 (`could`, `current`) has no DEC.
Every other requirement is `must`, `current`.

```
- FR-001: covered by EPIC-004. No action.
- FR-002: blocked: [NEEDS ADR] marker without a matching question ("calendar sync with the practice system"). Resolve it with /devforgeai:architecture PRD-003.
- FR-003: blocked by DEC-02 (ADR-006 superseded by ADR-009). Resolve it with /devforgeai:architecture PRD-003.
- FR-004: later (release later); blocked by DEC-03 (open). No action for the current release.
- FR-005: undecided (priority null). The PRD owner decides.
```

FR-002 is blocked although DEC-01, which cites it, is resolved: DEC-01 asks about data ownership, not
calendar sync. The eligible requirements are FR-006 and NFR-001. NFRs are never covered, so even if
EPIC-004 also refined NFR-001, your proposal would still attach it to the new epic it constrains.
