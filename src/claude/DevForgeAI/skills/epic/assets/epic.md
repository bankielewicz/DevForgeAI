# EPIC-000 — <capability name>

<!-- An epic is a slice of value too large for one story. It groups PRD requirements
     into a deliverable capability and defines when that capability is complete.
     It does not describe implementation. -->

## 1. Goal

<!-- One paragraph: what users can do when this epic is done that they cannot do today. -->

## 2. Business value

<!-- Prose. The success metrics this epic moves are linked in frontmatter `upstream`. -->

## 3. Scope

**In scope**
- <item>

**Out of scope**
- <item> (covered by <other epic> or "not planned")

## 4. Done when

<!-- Cross-story criteria that can only be checked once several stories are complete.
     Broader than story AC. Every DW- item must be satisfied by at least one story AC
     (the checker reports DW items with no satisfying AC). -->

```yaml items
done_when:
  - id: DW-01
    status: active
    criterion: "<integrated outcome>"
    evidence_method: "<end-to-end test, demo or metric>"
```

## 5. Dependencies and risks

<!-- Prose. Hard blockers go in frontmatter `blocked_by`. -->

## 6. Technical notes (optional)

<!-- High-level constraints only. Detailed design goes in SPEC and ADR documents. -->

## 7. Story map

<!-- GENERATED from stories whose upstream cites this epic: story, title, status, DW satisfied.
     Do not edit by hand. -->

## 8. Open questions

- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: <question>]
