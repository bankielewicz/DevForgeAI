description: Takes work in a git repository from changed files to merged, synced and cleaned up. It connects a repository to its remote, starts a branch and worktree for the work, classifies changes before staging, scans for secrets, runs the repository's checks, commits, pushes, opens or updates a GitHub pull request, merges only a PR that QA labeled merge-approved and the user confirms, fast-forwards the default branch without losing local edits, and prunes merged worktrees. Use when the user asks to initialize a repository or connect it to a remote, commit changes, commit and push, push a branch, open, update or merge a PR, start a branch or worktree for a task, sync or pull main, check the repository's git or PR status, or clean up old worktrees and branches, even when they don't name the skill. Not for explaining git concepts or commands.

# Git

Deliver work in the user's repository: connect it to its remote, isolate the work in a branch and
worktree, decide what belongs in each commit, commit, push, open a pull request, merge it when QA
approved it and the user authorizes the merge, bring the local default branch up to date, and
prune worktrees that are no longer needed. Every phase starts from the repository's real state and
ends with the completion response.

Three rules shape everything below:
- **No data loss.** Never overwrite, reset, clean or remove a path whose content isn't proven to
  exist elsewhere (in a commit, a branch or the incoming version).
- **Nothing outward-facing or destructive without authorization** (the gates below).
- **The repository's rules win.** Its instructions and ADRs override this skill's defaults (worktree
  location, branch names, commit format, checks, merge method, post-merge steps), except the two
  rules above.

## Inputs

- `$ARGUMENTS`, optional: a phase (`status`, `connect`, `start`, `commit`, `push`, `pr`, `merge`,
  `sync`, `prune`), then free text: a remote URL for `connect`, a branch or task for `start`, a PR
  number for `merge`, idle and stale ages in days for `prune` (defaults 14 and 30). With no phase,
  infer the phases from the request and the state report.
- The repository: its git state, its remote, PR data from `gh`, and its instructions (`CLAUDE.md`,
  `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING*`, and ADRs or runbooks about branches, worktrees, commits, PRs, merges
  or deploys).
- The conversation: the task, the files this session edited, and authorizations already given in it.

**Tools.** Bash for `git`, `gh` and the scripts; Read, Glob and Grep; Edit and Write only for ignore
files; AskUserQuestion for gates; EnterWorktree with `path`, to move the session into a worktree
this skill created; Skill, only to run documents-updater after the user says yes (step 6). Run
commands with the working directory at the root of the checkout they target, except `git push` and
`gh pr`, which run from any checkout as commands of their own (step 6). Never install anything.
Never run a `devforgeai` command: that CLI doesn't exist.

Scripts, run with `python3`, all read-only and offline:
- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/repo_state.py [-C CHECKOUT] [--default-branch NAME] [--prs -]`: the
  state report (JSON). `--prs -` reads `gh pr list --state all --json
  number,state,headRefName,headRefOid` on stdin and adds each worktree's `pr` and `nothing_unpushed`.
- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/scan_staged.py`: the pre-publish scan; exit 1 is a blocked finding.
- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/qa_state.py`: the PR's QA state, from `gh pr view` JSON on stdin.

Read their JSON; never paste it into the reply. **Exit 2 from any script means it didn't run**: say
why (its `error`), do nothing that needed its answer, and never treat it as a finding or a state.

## Gates: what may run

Every action has a class. Check it before running anything.

| Class | Examples | Allowed when |
|---|---|---|
| Read-only | status, log, diff, fetch, ls-remote, `gh pr view`, `gh pr checks`, the scripts | Always |
| Local, reversible | `git init`, adding a remote, a branch or worktree, staging, a commit, an ignore-file edit, a fast-forward | The request asks for the phase that does it |
| Outward-facing | push, creating or editing a PR, merging | The request names that action ("commit this and open a PR" authorizes the commit, the push and the PR), or the user confirms it in this run |
| Destructive | removing a worktree, deleting a local or remote branch, `git rm --cached`, discarding working-tree content not proven to exist elsewhere, dropping a stash, rewriting pushed commits | A confirmation naming each target, every time, even when the request names the action |

- **A run** is one invocation of this skill, including the user's answers to its questions, whether
  given through AskUserQuestion or in the reply to a question that ended the turn. Authorization
  doesn't carry over to a later run. Phases inferred from the request (step 2) count as asked for;
  an outward-facing action still has to be named in the request or confirmed.
- **Merge is never authorized in advance.** It needs QA's approval (step 7) and a confirmation the
  user gives after this run's readiness report.
- **Asking.** Ask one question per phase, listing the exact commands and targets, with the
  recommended option first. Use AskUserQuestion when it is available and continue once it is
  answered; otherwise ask in plain text and end the turn. **When no answer can arrive** (no user
  is present, or AskUserQuestion isn't available and the run must end), do nothing that needs the
  answer, finish what doesn't, and report `awaiting_approval` with the question in Action required.
- **Refused commands (ERR-16).** When the sandbox or a harness or permission guard refuses a command,
  never retry it another way (path, command form, script copy, tool) or change those settings:
  finish what doesn't need it and give the user the exact command.

**Never run these without a confirmation naming the exact target:** `push --force-with-lease`,
`reset --hard`, `clean`, `checkout --` or `restore` over content not proven identical, `branch -D`,
`stash drop` or `stash clear`, a rebase or amend of pushed commits, `git rm --cached`, deleting a
remote branch, merging unrelated histories.

**Never run these at all:** `push --force` or `-f`, a `+<refspec>` push, any forced push to the
default branch; `gh pr merge --admin`, `--auto` or `--delete-branch`; any command that adds, removes
or creates a QA label or posts a QA verdict; `--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`, or a `-c` override of
hooks or signing; `filter-branch` or `filter-repo`; `worktree remove --force`, or `rm` on a
worktree; `git config --global` or `--system`, or any other change to git configuration outside the
repository; changes to Claude Code's sandbox or permission settings; staging with `git add -A`,
`git add .`, `git add -u` or `git commit -a`; `git pull` without `--ff-only`.

Before a step that moves a branch or rewrites commits, record how to undo it: a backup ref
`refs/devforgeai-backup/<branch>/<UTC yyyymmddThhmmssZ>` (local, never pushed), the previous SHA,
or a stash ref. When a step fails midway, stop, leave the state as it is, and give the exact
commands that restore the previous state.

## Decisions that belong to the user

- Every confirmation the gates require, and the merge method (among those the repository allows).
- Which paths are part of the task when the request, the session's edits and the diff don't settle
  it: an uncertain path is never staged, only named.
- Whether to commit despite a failed check or a scan warning. A blocked scan finding is never
  committed, even when the user asks.
- Whether to carry local-only commits of the default branch into a new branch's PR (step 4).
- Changing `origin`, merging unrelated histories, renumbering a colliding document ID, removing
  ignored files that aren't regenerable, and deleting backup refs.
- Whether to run documents-updater before a PR.
- QA verdicts and labels belong to an independent QA session or the human, never to this skill,
  even when asked (step 7).

## Workflow

Copy this checklist into your response, and tick each step or mark it `(skipped: <reason>)`:

```
- [ ] 1. Preflight and state report
- [ ] 2. Choose the phases
- [ ] 3. connect
- [ ] 4. start
- [ ] 5. commit
- [ ] 6. push / pr
- [ ] 7. merge
- [ ] 8. sync
- [ ] 9. prune
- [ ] 10. Report
```

### 1. Preflight and state report

Follow [references/preflight-and-connect.md](references/preflight-and-connect.md). With read-only
commands: confirm the repository root and whether this is the main checkout or a linked worktree;
read the repository's instructions; check that git runs, that `user.name` and `user.email`
resolve, whether HEAD is detached and whether an operation is in progress. For phases that use the
remote, check it is reachable (`git ls-remote`) and read its default branch with
`git ls-remote --symref origin HEAD`; never assume `main`. Check `gh` (installed, `gh auth status`)
only before a step that needs it. Fetch, then run `repo_state.py` and base every decision on it.

Stop with ERR-01 when git is missing or this isn't a repository and nobody asked to create one,
and with ERR-05 when an operation is in progress or HEAD is detached and the phase needs a branch.
When the report shows `sandbox.git_config_write_masked`, plan every phase without `.git/config`
writes (`--no-track`, a push without `-u`) and report what still can't run (ERR-16).

### 2. Choose the phases

Take the phase from the first argument, or infer the phases from the request and the report: "open
a PR for my changes" with uncommitted work runs start, commit and pr. Order: connect, start,
commit, push, pr, merge, sync, prune. Skip what the request doesn't need, and stop at the first
gate that needs an answer. `start` commits only work it carries (step 4), and never pushes;
`commit` is for later commits in the worktree. `status` runs step 1, reports the changes, the
default branch's ahead/behind state, the worktrees and the PR's QA state, and changes nothing.
Before each phase, check whether its result already exists (origin set, branch or worktree present,
change committed, branch pushed, PR open, PR merged, default branch up to date), and report it
rather than repeat it. When start, commit, push or pr has nothing to deliver (no task changes, no
commits beyond the base), that is ERR-14: create nothing and report `no_change`. A start for new
work on a clean checkout isn't ERR-14. A request for a commit message only drafts it.

### 3. connect

[references/preflight-and-connect.md](references/preflight-and-connect.md): `git init` when asked,
`origin` from the given URL, a fetch, and adopting or bootstrapping the remote's history. Never
replace a different existing `origin` (ERR-03) or push over unrelated history (ERR-04). A push to an
empty remote is outward-facing: offer the bootstrap commit unless the request names the push.

### 4. start

[references/preflight-and-connect.md](references/preflight-and-connect.md). The branch name, and
the worktree at `<main_checkout>/.claude/worktrees/<name>` (unless the repository sets another
place), always under the main checkout: take `main_checkout` from the state report and pass
`git worktree add` that absolute path, so a run started in a linked worktree never nests a worktree
inside it. When `main_checkout` is `null` (a bare repository), ask where to put it; when the path is
refused, that is ERR-16, never a path inside the current worktree. Only when the report's
`claude_worktrees_ignored` is false, append the rule with
`echo '.claude/worktrees/' >> .git/info/exclude`, as its own Bash call from the main checkout's
root; if it is refused, create the worktree anyway and hand the command to the user.
- **No uncommitted work to carry:** create the branch and worktree together from the fetched
  `origin/<default>`.
- **Uncommitted work to carry:** first, when the current branch is the default branch and the
  report's `default_branch.ahead` is above 0, stop before staging anything: list the local-only
  commits (SHA and subject) and ask whether to stop (recommended: the request didn't name them) or
  include them in this branch's PR. Then classify, stage, scan and check the work (step 5),
  `git switch -c <branch>` at the current HEAD, commit, verify each carried path by hash, switch
  back, and only then add the worktree on that branch. Never move work with stash, copies or
  patches. The rebase onto `origin/<default>` comes before the push (step 6).

Then enter the worktree with EnterWorktree (`path`) when that tool is available. Otherwise the
session stays where it was (a `cd` in Bash doesn't move it): say so, and give the command that opens
the worktree, `claude --worktree <name>` from the main checkout.

### 5. commit

Follow [references/classify-and-commit.md](references/classify-and-commit.md):
1. **Classify** every change as `task`, `unrelated`, `local` or `blocked`; an uncertain path isn't
   staged. Stage task paths only, by explicit path (`git add -- <paths>`). Propose ignore patterns
   for local paths in the reply; write them only when asked or confirmed.
2. **Scan**: run `scan_staged.py`. A blocked finding (exit 1) stops the commit (ERR-06); a warning
   needs the user's yes, and with no answer possible nothing is committed in this phase. Exit 2
   means the scan didn't run: commit nothing and report why. Name file and line, never a value.
3. **Check**: run the checks the repository's instructions require, as they say, and report each
   as passed, failed or not run. A failed check stops the commit (ERR-07) unless the user confirms.
4. **Commit** in the repository's message convention, one commit per logical change, letting hooks
   and signing run.

### 6. push / pr

Follow [references/publish-and-merge.md](references/publish-and-merge.md), in this order:
1. **`pr` only:** when the branch's diff against `origin/<default>` (naming `<branch>`, not HEAD)
   changes files other than documentation but neither README nor CHANGELOG, recommend
   `/devforgeai:documents-updater` and ask whether to run it first. Run it only on the user's yes;
   with a no, or no answer possible, continue and list "documentation not reviewed".
2. Fetch, and run the state report in the branch's checkout. **`pr` only:** stop on a colliding
   document ID (ERR-15), before any rebase.
3. When the base moved and the branch's commits are unpushed, rebase them onto `origin/<default>`;
   on a conflict run `git rebase --abort` and stop (ERR-08). Push with `git push origin <branch>` as
   a command of its own (never chained, after `cd … &&`, or as `git -C`), from any checkout.
4. **`pr` only:** now check `gh` and a GitHub remote (ERR-02), then reuse the branch's open PR or
   create one, each `gh pr` call a command of its own. Name the next step: an independent QA
   session reviews the PR.

### 7. merge

Follow [references/publish-and-merge.md](references/publish-and-merge.md). Derive the QA state with
`gh pr view <n> --json labels,comments,headRefOid | python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/qa_state.py"`.
Give the readiness report, with the verdict comment's author and URL. Offer the merge only when the
QA state is `approved` and nothing else blocks it (ERR-10). Merge only after the user confirms, with
the method they choose and `--match-head-commit <head SHA>`. Delete the remote branch only after a
confirmation naming it. A `failed` state sends the PR back to development: report QA's findings as
the work to do. Never add, remove or create a QA label, and never post a verdict.

### 8. sync

Follow [references/sync-and-prune.md](references/sync-and-prune.md). `git fetch --prune`, record a
backup ref for the local default branch, then act on its state: fast-forward only when it is
behind; stop when it is ahead or diverged (ERR-11). Reconcile from the state report of the checkout
that holds the default branch (`repo_state.py -C <checked_out_at>`). Before a fast-forward that
would overwrite local edits, reconcile each path: restore or remove it only when the report calls
it `identical` (its working copy and mode equal the incoming version, and its index holds nothing
found only there); otherwise keep it byte-identical and stop (ERR-12). Then run or report the
repository's post-merge steps. Retire branches the sync shows as merged only by step 9's removal
rules: ask about each worktree's non-regenerable ignored files before removing anything.

### 9. prune

Follow [references/sync-and-prune.md](references/sync-and-prune.md). Inventory the linked
worktrees from the state report, run with `--prs -` when `gh` works. A worktree is removable only
when it is merged or closed, clean, not locked, not current, and `nothing_unpushed` (every commit on
a remote ref, or the tip equal to a merged PR's head; without `gh`, by ancestry, said so). Age never
makes one removable. A worktree whose `commits_since_created` is 0 has no commits since it was
created: say that, not "merged". Report every other worktree with its reason (ERR-13), disk size and
activity (idle at 14 days, stale at 30; a locked one is reported as locked). List each removable
worktree's ignored files and ask about any that isn't regenerable. Remove removable ones only after
one confirmation listing them, with `git worktree remove`, then retire their branches safely.

### 10. Report

Read [references/output-rules.md](references/output-rules.md) and check its self-check list. End
the reply with the completion response, and put nothing after it.

## Output contract

The last thing in the reply, with empty fields omitted:

```text
Result: done | partial | blocked | awaiting_approval | no_change
Phases: <phases run, in order>
Branch: <branch> → <base>
PR: <URL, state>
Checks: <each check: passed, failed or not run>
Changes: <committed, left unstaged, proposed for ignoring, blocked>
Action required: <approval needed, conflict, recovery command, the user's own step>
```

`done`: every requested phase finished. `partial`: some finished and an issue remains. `blocked`:
nothing could proceed. `awaiting_approval`: a gate needs an answer. `no_change`: everything
requested was already done, or there was nothing to deliver. Show the ticked checklist once, before
this block.

## Examples

**Start from a linked worktree.** In `.claude/worktrees/feat-a`, "start a worktree for fix/b" with
`main_checkout` `/home/u/proj` runs `git worktree add --no-track -b fix/b
/home/u/proj/.claude/worktrees/fix-b origin/main`, never a path under `feat-a`: `Result: done`.

**Merge.** "Merge PR 42." The QA state is `stale`: QA's passing verdict names an older commit. The
skill gives the readiness report, doesn't offer the merge, and reports `Result: blocked`: an
independent QA session must review the new head.
