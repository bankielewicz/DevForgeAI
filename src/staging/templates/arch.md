# ARCH-000 — <system> architecture

<!-- An architecture description records the system-level decisions that separate epics must share:
     boundaries, responsibilities, data ownership, major interactions, deployment, and the quality
     requirements driving them. Exact API fields, migrations and class structures belong in specs.
     Significant choices are ADRs; this document shows how they fit together.
     Confirming the outcome (reuse / amend / create) never accepts the decisions inside it. -->

## 1. Context and scope

<!-- What the system is for, what's inside and outside it, and which PRD version this was defined against. -->

## 2. Quality drivers

<!-- Prose: the NFRs and constraints that shape the design. Components cite them in their upstream links. -->

## 3. Components

```yaml items
components:
  - id: CMP-01
    status: active
    name: "<component>"
    responsibility: "<what it is responsible for>"
    owns_data:
      - "<data it is the owner of>"
    interacts_with:
      - "<CMP-NN or external system>"
    deployment: "<deployment unit>"
    upstream:
      - {id: PRD-000, item: NFR-001, relation: informed_by, version: 1, hash: null}
```

## 4. Architectural questions

<!-- One item per question that separate epics must agree on. upstream lists the requirements the
     question affects, at the PRD version examined. A requirement is ready for epics only when every
     blocking question that cites it is resolved by an accepted, non-superseded ADR or an approved,
     active policy setting. Never mark a question resolved without an explicit decision. -->

```yaml items
decisions:
  - id: DEC-01
    status: active
    question: "<the architectural question>"
    blocking: true
    state: open               # open | resolved
    resolved_by: []           # ADR-NNN or POL-NNN#SET-NN when resolved
    notes: null
    upstream:
      - {id: PRD-000, item: FR-001, relation: informed_by, version: 1, hash: null}
```

## 5. Evidence inspected

<!-- Every source consulted. classification keeps observed practice, approved policy and accepted
     decisions apart. Insufficient evidence is an explicit unknown, never a confident "reuse". -->

```yaml items
evidence:
  - id: EVD-01
    status: active
    source: "<path, ADR-NNN or POL-NNN#SET-NN>"
    kind: code                # code | document | adr | policy | prd
    finding: "<what it shows>"
    classification: observed  # observed | policy | decided
```

## 6. Deployment

<!-- Prose plus optional Mermaid: deployment units, environments, and what runs where. -->

## 7. Requirement changes proposed to the PRD owner

<!-- Findings that need a PRD amendment (infeasible, too costly, conflicting). This document never
     edits the PRD; the owner decides. -->

## 8. Open questions

- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: <question>]
