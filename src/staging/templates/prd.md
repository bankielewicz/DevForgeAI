# PRD-000 — <product or release name>

<!-- The PRD states WHAT and WHY, not HOW. Every requirement is an item with its
     own ID and its own upstream link. Design choices belong in a Spec or ADR. -->

## 1. Summary

<!-- Two or three sentences a stakeholder can read in 20 seconds. -->

## 2. Problem and opportunity

<!-- Prose. The problems themselves are linked in frontmatter `upstream`. -->

## 3. Users and personas

<!-- Prose or a table: persona, goal, context and frequency. -->

## 4. Goals and non-goals

**Goals**
- <outcome>

**Non-goals** (explicitly out of scope)
- <thing we will not do, and why>

## 5. Success metrics

<!-- Outcome measures, often observed after release. These are NOT story acceptance criteria. -->

```yaml items
success_metrics:
  - id: SM-01
    status: active
    metric: "<metric>"
    baseline: "<today's value>"
    target: "<target value>"
    measured_by: "<dashboard or query>"
    upstream:
      - {id: BRN-000, item: IDEA-01, relation: derives, version: 1, hash: null}
```

## 6. Functional requirements

<!-- One testable capability per item. Use "shall". Every item needs an upstream link.
     priority: must | should | could | wont (MoSCoW importance within its release).
     release: current (this PRD's target_release) | later (backlog).
     Both stay null until the user decides; a PRD can't be approved while any is null. -->

```yaml items
functional_requirements:
  - id: FR-001
    status: active
    statement: "The system shall <capability>."
    priority: null            # must | should | could | wont
    release: null             # current | later
    notes: null
    upstream:
      - {id: BRN-000, item: IDEA-01, relation: derives, version: 1, hash: null}
```

## 7. Non-functional requirements

<!-- Make each one measurable. category: performance | security | privacy | accessibility |
     reliability | compliance | observability | usability | maintainability | constraint | other
     "constraint" records a fixed external condition (mandated platform, integration, data
     residency, existing system). It never records a design choice: those go in an ADR or spec. -->

```yaml items
non_functional_requirements:
  - id: NFR-001
    status: active
    category: performance
    statement: "<p95 latency < N ms at M requests/s>"
    priority: null
    release: null
    upstream:
      - {id: BRN-000, item: PRB-01, relation: derives, version: 1, hash: null}
```

## 8. User experience

<!-- Key flows, wireframe links, content requirements. Link to designs; do not embed large ones. -->

## 9. Constraints and dependencies

<!-- Prose context only. Each constraint that a spec must obey is an NFR item with
     category: constraint (section 7), so specs can cite it. -->

## 10. Assumptions and risks

```yaml items
assumptions:
  - id: ASM-01
    status: active
    statement: "<assumption or risk>"
    validation: "<how we will confirm it or mitigate it>"
    state: open               # open | validated | invalidated
    upstream:                 # delete if the assumption is new in this PRD
      - {id: BRN-000, item: ASM-01, relation: derives, version: 1, hash: null}
```

## 11. Release and rollout

<!-- Phasing, feature flags, migration, launch criteria. -->

## 12. Open questions

- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: <question>]

## 13. Epic map

<!-- GENERATED: epics whose upstream cites this PRD. Do not edit by hand. -->
