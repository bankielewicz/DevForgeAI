# Utility runtime contract

Implementation target: separate skill-builder and skill-validator adapters, preserving the brainstorm contract. Mechanical checks do not certify semantic quality, reviewer honesty, human adoption, native callback origin or release acceptance.

A `devforge.utility-session/v1` session selects a `devforge.utility-delivery/v1` contract, external assignment, installed resources, deadline, correction limit, output preimages, checkpoint and receipt destinations. The delivery contract has explicit ordered phases and task classifications, allowed outputs and typed evidence requirements. Known utility phase order is fixed; the owner explicitly binds classification and applicability. Validator W1/P1-P6/T01-T12 are Enforced and cannot be excluded to obtain a passing result.

Every checkpoint binds task, phase, journal sequence, fresh challenge and selected input digest. The model supplies concrete evidence and references. The runtime reads the selected actual files, checks required format/fields and preserves their bytes in its protected journal. Marker-only submissions, wrong phase/task, stale/replayed nonce, wrong producer or missing evidence cannot advance. Accepted artifacts are immutable for the task. A changed output requires a new affected assignment rather than rewriting an accepted phase.

Finite-choice waiting may use an exact answer rule supplied in the selected contract; unrelated text leaves WAITING_USER. Free-text consequential answers require a separately recorded authoritative interpretation bound to the exact pending question and observed prompt; a model declaration is insufficient. Reopening context, synthetic continuation prompts, elapsed time and arbitrary user-message arrival never mean adoption. Deadlines and correction counts do not reset on waiting/resume.

At READY, runtime verifies all accepted outputs, publishes the receipt exclusively, reads its complete bytes back and rechecks current targets before reporting completion. The handoff excludes its own digest and is not rewritten. Receipt, callback transport, client completion, renderer observation and receiving invocation are independent facts. Receipt collisions and changed final bytes prevent a current completion claim. Failure reports can be prepared even when passing evidence is unavailable.

Validator contracts must select external `deterministic-inspection` (P2), `independent-review` (P3), and `native-prerequisites`, `native-C`, `native-B`, `native-A` (P4) gate files. Omitting or moving these gates rejects admission. Each gate binds its allocated producer, task, phase, contract digest, outcome, reason and pinned underlying evidence. The receipt retains each outcome separately. A producer pin proves which allocated bytes were consumed; it does not prove the producer's judgment or execution authenticity. Required structured fields reject null, blank strings and empty collections; scalar truth values retain their domain meaning.

The supervisor protects runtime code/state, fixed sources and receipt paths from the worker. Its existing synthetic process interface exercises the utility adapter without pretending native execution. A native launcher must independently establish the selected client, authentication, effective hook configuration and one callback per occurrence. Installation/compatibility alone is not admission.

`native-admission --attempt <id>` currently reserves a C attempt only. It requires active validator P4, passing independent P2/P3 evidence, a complete pinned plan, prepared disjoint workspace/client-state directories and external boundary observations. The selected client binary must be outside every attempt-writable root. The result explicitly reports `native_launch_admitted: false` and `execution: NOT_RUN`. Reuse is rejected. B/A reservations are rejected because the authenticated prior-result importer and native launcher/scheduler are not implemented. Native C/B/A gates therefore admit only explicit NOT_RUN/COULD_NOT_RUN reporting; supplied PASS/FAIL execution declarations cannot substitute for that missing importer. This revision does not deliver native C/B/A execution or enforce a running client's attempt/time budgets. Session deadlines and correction budgets are enforced for the utility state machine.

This is an incomplete integration revision. Native callback coverage, actual builder-to-validator invocation and delivery remain unobserved. For this continuation the user explicitly selected all five builder phases and their required actions as Enforced. Actual managed assignments must bind that decision; the generic adapter does not adopt a test fixture's classifications for unrelated work.

Official source inspected on 2026-09-07: https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/hooks. The selected synchronous callback interface uses SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit (prompt field), Stop and SessionEnd; matching sources accumulate, trust is definition-specific and tool hooks are not a complete sandbox. The runtime is the authority boundary; hooks transport observations and feedback. Codex CLI observed: 0.153.4. Live native support remains to be measured on a separately frozen allocation.


## Client-independent scheduling checkpoint

The Python module `runtime/delivery/native_schedule.py` supplies an in-memory scheduling and budget policy component for a previously validated frozen experiment. Its supplemental `required_predecessors` map is an explicit caller-owned input, not a new accepted field in `devforge.utility-native-plan/v1`. The protected caller must establish that this frozen map covers the actual case requirements; an empty list cannot self-exclude required coverage.

The component preserves declared C/B/A order, independent attempt identities and explicit prerequisite relationships. It reserves each attempt once, keeps at most one reservation in flight, consumes an allocation even when launch fails, and bounds each attempt by its own limit and the experiment's original elapsed-time budget. Intact B quality FAIL observations may satisfy a declared observation dependency; required C dependencies need intact PASS. Missing or contaminated predecessor observations block dependent attempts while declared independent work may continue.

Elapsed time is supplied from one authoritative experiment origin including waiting/resume. An expired reservation returns a stop-required decision and remains in flight until its protected caller stops/reaps the owned process and records a terminal observation. The component does not stop processes itself. It rejects late quality grades under its recording-time policy; selecting authenticated capture-time semantics belongs to result-import integration.

The pure component alone supplies no persistent custody or authenticated result importer. The following journal adapter now owns its state. Neither immutable Python values nor a completed allocation establishes native execution or evaluation PASS.

## Protected scheduling interface

`devforge.utility-native-schedule/v1` is a separate frozen document with exactly `schema_version`, `task_id`, `plan` (absolute path and SHA-256), and `required_predecessors`. The plan pin must match the protected native-prerequisites producer's selected native-plan/v1 bytes. The map has one entry per allocated attempt. This version requires every B attempt to depend on all C attempts in the same arm/repetition, and every A attempt to depend on all C and B attempts in that scope. Missing preceding-tier coverage, extra/missing dependencies, wrong scope or a substituted plan rejects binding. This conservative version supports no per-case dependency exemptions.

The operator interface is:

```text
devforge delivery --state <protected-state> native-schedule-bind --schedule <external-binding.json>
devforge delivery --state <protected-state> native-schedule-reserve
devforge delivery --state <protected-state> native-schedule-cancel --attempt <id> --reason <reason>
```

These operations are external controller actions, not worker fallbacks. Binding requires active validator P4 after passing independent P2/P3 gates and complete native prerequisites. It is exclusive, pins actual bytes in the locked journal and records its original clock from the operator's transition timestamp. Its entire campaign budget must fit within the enclosing session deadline. Every reload replays the plan-bound transitions; callers cannot submit replacement scheduler state, elapsed time, grades or termination claims. Legacy native-admission and scheduled reservations cannot mix.

The reserve operation consumes one eligible allocation and issues no launch permission. Repeated calls while an attempt is in flight retain that attempt and its original deadline. Expiry marks stop-required without silently settling it. P4 cannot advance with an unsettled reservation. The only terminal operation currently exposed is cancellation of an **unlaunched** reservation with a fixed CANCELLED/UNOBTAINABLE observation. Such cancellation may be recorded after session expiry; it cannot reopen the session or authorize further work. Clock rollback before any journal write is rejected. Current dependency, evidence and source drift remain fail-closed.

Both scheduling modules are embedded in the Rust delivery package and routed through the protected controller. The supervisor still refuses native launches, and executed C/B/A PASS/FAIL declarations remain refused. No process/result importer is implemented, so these journal tests cannot establish actual process termination, native callback provenance, behavioral success or receiving execution. Integrating that owned-process lifecycle remains required after the user approves the actual client/authentication configuration and evaluation budget.
